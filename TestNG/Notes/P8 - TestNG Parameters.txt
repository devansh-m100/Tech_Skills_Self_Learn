My Notes - 

1) Parameter tag in xml is scope specific, like if you add it outside test & inside suite, it will have full suite scope and if you add parameter tag inside test it will have test scope.

2) The main use of TestNG Parameters is when you want to take some input from the user rather than giving your own input in the code.

Tutorial Notes - 
In this video, I have explained about "Assertions in TestNG".

Points Covered:
What is meant by an assertion?
Are the assertions mandatory in tests?
How to perform the assertions?

My Notes based on tutorial - 

1) Assertion is an expression which will verify the actual test outcome with expected test outcome.

2) Assert are static methods.

3) String actualTitle = driver.getTitle();
		String expectedTitle = "HYR Tutorials - Google Searchh";
		assertEquals(actualTitle, expectedTitle, "Title is Mismatched");

4) To be able to use all the Asserts at once, go to import & put .* rather than .AssertEquals.
